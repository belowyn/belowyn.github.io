So, sitting at my parents place in the middle of nowhere, the night before my great uncle's funeral, I start messing with Jekyll.

Inspired by my recent workings with git, and a look at [github pages][gh-pages] I wanted to reboot my experience with webpages and perhaps even some slight blogging.

Getting a simple, but informative and updated site up and running might be a good investment when I am currently looking for a new job. The experience with git and jekyll will be good to have, and I might even have some fun with it as well.

I think this should be it for tonight. Tomorrow will be a long day. [Olav][olav] was like a grandfather to me, and may his soul rest in peace.
